am trying to enable cors in express server but does not seem to be working

 have MEAN stack application with the client (live server on port 4200) and express server listening on port 5000. now i install cors and enable it but each time the client is making a (POST or GET) request it ends up with the following error:


 Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:5000/api/login' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

 uri = 'http://localhost:5000/api';
login (user) {
  return this.http.post(`${this.uri}/login`, user,{withCredentials: true});               
}

const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({origin:["localhost:4200"], credentials: true}))
